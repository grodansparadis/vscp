This class is able to serialize and unserialize binary data, so you can read files generated with C, pascal, etc as well as generate such data.
It's also able to handle the byte order (big/little endian) and supports the following types: signed integer (small 8 bits, short 16 bits, int 32 bits), unsigned integer (byte 8 bits, word 16 bits, dword 32 bits) and floating point (IEEE754 float 32 bits and double 64 bits).

Constructor

	BinaryParser([bigEndian: Boolean = false], [allowExceptions: Boolean = false])
	
		Generates an instance of BinaryParser.
		
			bigEndian if true, the class will assume the bigEndian format for the input and output, otherwise, it will assume the little endian format.
			allowExceptions if true, when number=>binary conversion error occur an exception will be raised (which can be caught through a "try..except" block)
		
	


Properties

	BinaryParser.bigEndian: Boolean if true, the class will assume the bigEndian format for the input and output, otherwise, it will assume the little endian format.
	BinaryParser.allowExceptions: Boolean if true, when number=>binary conversion error occur an exception will be raised (which can be caught through a "try..except" block)


Gerenic Methods

	BinaryParser.decodeFloat(data: String, precisionBits: Integer, exponentBits: Integer): Float
	
		Decodes a string containing the binary representation of a number in the IEEE-754 pattern and returns the number or the following special values: NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity.
		
			data string containing the binary representation of the number (must contain at least "ceil((exponentBits + precisionBits + 1) / 8)" bytes)
			precisionBits amount of bits that specifies the precision/mantisse
			exponentBits amount of bits that specifies the exponent
		
	
	BinaryParser.encodeFloat(number: Float, precisionBits: Integer, exponentBits: Integer): String
	
		Encodes a number into the IEEE-754 pattern and returns the binary representation of it in a string containing "ceil((exponentBits + precisionBits + 1) / 8)" bytes.
		
			number number to be converted
			precisionBits amount of bits that specifies the precision/mantisse
			exponentBits amount of bits that specifies the exponent
		
	
	BinaryParser.decodeInt(data: String, bits: Integer, signed: Boolean): Integer
	
		Decodes a string containing binary data and returns the number that it represents.
		
			data string containing the binary representation of the number (must contain at least "ceil(bits / 8)" bytes)
			bits amount of bits that specifies the quantity of numbers that can be represented
			signed indicates if the number must be decoded with signal or without signal
		
	
	BinaryParser.encodeInt(number: Int, bits: Integer, signed: Boolean): Integer
	
		Encodes an integer number and returns it's binary representation on a string containing "ceil(bits / 8)" bytes.
		
			number number to be converted
			bits amount of bits that specifies the quantity of numbers that can be represented
			signed indicates if the number must be encoded with signal or without signal
		
	


Methods (Float Point)
