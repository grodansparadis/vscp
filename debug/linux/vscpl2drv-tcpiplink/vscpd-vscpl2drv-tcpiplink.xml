      runasuser  - Switch to given user credentials after startup. Usually, 
                   this option is required when vscpd needs to bind on 
                   privileged ports on UNIX. To do that, vscpd needs to 
                   be started as root. From a security point of view, running 
                   as root is not advisable, therefore this option can be used 
                   to drop privileges.
