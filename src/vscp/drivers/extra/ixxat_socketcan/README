IXXAT Automation GmbH - SocketCAN Driver
=========================================


About SocketCAN Driver
----------------
The SocketCAN driver allows you to use IXXAT CAN Interfaces within your own
socketCAN based applications. For further informations on SocketCAN see 

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/can.txt

* Gcc 4.2 and a working kernel build environment

Note: 
  The driver should work with most Linux distributions running a 2.6.37 or newer, 
  but was only tested using Debian/Ubuntu and openSUSE Linux up to kernel version 4.4.21. 
  If using a Raspberry Pi, refer to the Raspberry Pi section below before starting the 
  steps in Getting started.


Getting started
------------------------------------
1) Make sure the can-dev module is loaded properly. 
   You can check this with "lsmod | grep can-dev"
   If it is not loaded yet you can do this with 

   "sudo modprobe can-dev"

2) Because you need to compile the "ixx_pci" kernel module you need to have
   have the source code of your operating kernel installed on your
   system and the kernel configuration file '/usr/src/linux/.config' should 
   exist. The "linux-headers" package matching your kernel version can also 
   be sufficient to build the kernel module.

   An easy way to get a working kernel build environment is to use 
   module-assistant(m-a). You can install it by typing 

   "sudo apt-get install module-assistant". 

   To let module-assistant install the necessary packages for you, you can use

   "sudo module-assistant prepare" 


Compiling the Kernel Module
---------------------------
1) After you made sure that the can-dev module is loaded
   and you have a working kernel build environment you 
   need to compile the IXXAT SocketCAN driver. To do this go 
   to the drivers directory and run 

   "make"

2) If this was successfull you can install all the usb and pci kernel modules by
   typing 

   "sudo make install"

   You can check the result with "dmesg". If there are interfaces connected
   you see i.e. 

   ixx_pci 0000:02:00.0 can0: attached to CAN-IB120/PCIe channel 0 (device HW302475)
   ixx_pci 0000:02:00.0 can1: attached to CAN-IB120/PCIe channel 1 (device HW302475)

   Now the module is ready to use.


Using SocketCAN
------------------------------------
1) Before you can send and receive data you need to configure 
   the interface. To do this you can use the 'ip' tool. For example if you 
   want to set the bitrate of 1Mbit (1000000 bit) to the can0 interface
   you can do this with

   "sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 1000000"

2) Now the bitrate is set and you can start the interface by typing

   "sudo ip link set can0 up"

3) After this you can send and receive data on can0. At the beginning you may
   just want to check some small communications. To do this you could use the
   tools from "can-utils". For example you could try to send data with

   "cansend can0 123#112233"
   
   and receive it with 
   
   "candump can0"
   
   As a prerequisite for this, is a connected and properly configured bus with
   at least two communication partners.

Raspberry Pi
------------------------------------
When using a Raspberry Pi with a standard kernel release, there are no kernel
or header files available.  This will require that the kernel is recompiled 
and installed on the device manually to allow the SocketCAN to function.  Refer
to the instructions provided at:
