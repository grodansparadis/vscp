Summary
=======

First of all. You don't need to build this package yourself. Everything here is 
installed for you in the binary version (see https://sourceforge.net/projects/m2m/files/vscp/).

To build the VSCP Project for WIN32/WIN64 there are 2 project files which
differ in the number of sub-projects included. They also require
different sets of external resources to run successfully:

   1.) vscp_project.sln
       Requires:
                - Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 (Can be downloaded free).
                - wxWidgets 3.0.0 or greater,
                - wxExpat,
                - various other libraries to compile drivers for specific hardware (info below).

       This project is described in the section "VSCP Project (complete)" below and is the
       project used for distributing the project. 
                   
   2.) vscp_project_minimal.sln
       Requires:
                - Free version of Visual Studio (no MFC required),
                - wxWidgets.

       This project is described in the section "VSCP Project Minimal" below.

Both of these project files can be found in the directory $(VSCP_HOME)/src/vscp



VSCP Project (complete)
=======================

This is the "original" project and includes all sub-projects.

- to build the vectorxl CANAL driver the proprietary vectorxl libs/includes is needed.
- to build the Peak CANAL driver the proprietary PEAK libs/includes is needed.
- to build the CSS CANAL driver the proprietary CCS libs/includes is needed.
- to build the IXXAT CANAL driver the proprietary IXXAT libs/includes is needed.

1.) Define environment variable VSCP_HOME that points to the VSCP base folder (c:\development\vscp_software).
    define environment variable VSCP_FIRMWARE that points to VSCP firmware base folder 
    (c:\development\vscp_firmware). If you want to build install file structure an environment
	variable called VSCP_INSTALL should be created (C:\Users\grodansparadis\development\vscp_install_win32). It
	will contain all binaries after a release build (32-bit/64-bit). Just point it to a temporary folder or
	something if no need for this.

2.) Install and build wxWidgets 3.1.0 or higher but others will probably 
    do to. You find the build files in the build folder of the wxWidgets project.
    Available at http://www.wxwidgets.org	

3.) Make an environment variable WXWIN that points to the wxWidgets installation directory.
    (e.g. c:\wxWidgets-3.1.0).

4.) Add the wxwin include directory to the list of include files under 
    tools->options->directories ('projects and solutions->VC++ Directories' on 2003/2005/2008) 
        $(WXWIN)\include 
        (c:\wxWidgets-3.0.2\include).
    This is not needed on Visual Studio 2010 and above

5.) expat(http://expat.sourceforge.net/) is needed to build the daemon and other applications in the suit.
    Download and install. Make a environment variable EXPAT32 that points to the 32-bit folder (
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Expat 2.1.0) and EXPAT64 that points to the 64-bit folder
	(C:\Users\grodansparadis\development\expat-2.1.0\win64). 

6.) Install OpenSLL from http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html  Set an environment variable to the 
    location you install the file to with the name OPENSSL32 ((C:\OpenSSL-Win32\lib\VC)) for 32-bit version and OPENSSL64 
	(C:\OpenSSL-Win64\lib\VC)for 64-bit version. 	

6.) To build the APOX driver and the tellstick driver the dxx driver which is available from ftdi 
    (http://www.ftdichip.com) is needed. Make an environment variable named "ftdi" that points on 
	this installation folder.

7.) To build ccsdrv include must point to directory which contains can.h and LIB must point 
    to directory that contains can.lib and candbg.lib (tools->options->directories). Make sure that the 
    can.dll driver from CC-Systems also is available in the path (system32).

8.) To build ixxatvcidrv you need to add the ixxat include directory and also add the ixxat
    lib directory to LIB( Xat11Reg.lib vci11un6.lib ) Add an environment variable IXXAT2 that
	that points to the ixxat version 2 vsci folder (C:\Users\akhe\development\ixxat_v2). Make sure 
	the IXXAT VCI driver version 2 is installed (http://www.ixxat.com/download_vci_en.html) 
	(C:\Program Files\IXXAT\VCI 2.20).

9.) To build the CANAL PEAK driver you need to install the PEAK driver and support libraries 
    from here http://www.peak-system.com/Support.55.0.html?&L=1 You need the driver and the PCAN-Basic API.
    Make an environment variable named PCANBASICAPI that points to the location where you unpack the
    PCAN-BASIC API
        
10.) expat is needed you build the daemon. Create an environment variable EXPAT  that points to the
    libexpat root folder. Expat is available here http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/  
	Expat is also needed for the level I lirc driver which interfaces http://winlirc.sourceforge.net/ 
        
11.) To build the vectorxl driver (vectorxldrv) an environment variable (VECTORDRV) vectorxl must be defined so it 
	points to the dll folder of the installation (C:\Users\akhe\development\Vector_CANLIB\dll). The low level driver 
	from vectorxl must be installed for the CANAL driver to work. Current the old driver is used which can be found here 
	http://download.vectorxl.com/drivers/xl_lib90.zip

12.) To build the rawethernet driver the wpcap library and include files need to be installed on the system. A
	environment variable named "pcap" should point to folder of the project (where the include and lib folders are).
	install the latest wpdpak from http://www.winpcap.org/archive/ and point the environment variable to it.
	wincap (the driver) itself needs to be installed as well (http://www.winpcap.org.	


VSCP Minimal Project
====================

The Visual C++ solution vscp_project_minimal.sln is a workspace that
includes a subset of the projects in vscp_project.sln. It is intended
to enable anyone to compile the most essential modules of the VSCP
project. For this, only freely available resources are needed. These
are Microsoft Visual C++ Express Edition 2008 and wxWidgets 2.8.10
(2.8.9 are ok too). The difference of the Microsoft Visual C++ Express
Edition to a full (pay) Visual C++ is that it doesn't include the
Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC). MFC is needed to compile
some sub projects of VSCP. Newer projects should not use MFC.


Prerequisites
-------------
    
    * Visual C++ Express Edition 2008 
    * wxWidgets 2.8.10 (most recent stable release as of May 2009), 
      wxWidgets 2.8.9 works as well.
    * If you would like to compile lircdrv and lirctest you will 
      need expat.

    * There is no need to setup your environment with "subst J:" as
      shown above.

    * Although not strictly necessary it is wise to set the
      environment variable VSCP_HOME.


Build wxWidgets
---------------

We assume wxWidgets-2.8.12 will be installed in the directory
C:\wxWidgets-2.8.12. When installed proceed with these steps:

    * Open wx.dsw (in the directory C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\build\msw).
    * When asked to convert the project wx_xxxx.dsp into the current 
      format confirm with "Yes, all".
    * Go into "Build | Batch Rebuild", click onto the column header 
      "Configuration" to sort all entries by configuration. Tick all 
      configurations for
          o Debug,
          o Release,
          o Unicode Debug,
          o Unicode Release,
    * And click "Rebuild". That will take a few minutes.
    * Compilation should finish with 0 errors and 0 warnings.


Build VSCP
----------

Make sure the environment variable WXWIN is set to
C:\wxWidgets-2.8.12. You can do this in Control Panel | System |
Advanced | Environment Variables.

The supported configurations of the VSCP project are:
    * Debug
    * Debug Unicode
    * Release
    * Release Unicode

Select one of these configurations in the drop down box in the toolbar
of Visual C++ and build. Alternatively you can select the desired
configurations and sub-projects in Build | Batch build.

The build output is copied to the directory
$VSCP_HOME\src\vscp\build\<configuration>.

Please report problems to the VSCP mailing list: m2m-development@lists.sourceforge.net

Note: To build lircdrv and lirctest the additional library expat
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/) is needed.

Notes on making your own applications
-------------------------------------
If you build GUI application that use the vscp helper dll the wxUSE_GUI=1 should be in your preprocessor directives. 
If you build non-guid components define wxUSE_GUI=0

Building libwebsockets on the windows platform
----------------------------------------------
Follow the instruction and use

 cmake -DWITH_SSL=0 -G "Visual Studio 10" ..  
 
 to generate the makefiles.
