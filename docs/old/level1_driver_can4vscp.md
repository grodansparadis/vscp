# CAN4VSCP Level I Driver

**Available for:** Windows, Linux

**Driver for Windows** vscpl1_can4vscpdrv.dll (install-dir/drivers)

**Driver for Linux** vscpl1_can4vscpdrv.so (*/usr/local/lib/vscpl1_can4vscpdrv.so*) When using the drive on Linux remember to set rw permissions for the user that the VSCP daemon and VSCP works run under (*chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0* for example).

This is a driver for the low cost **Frankfurt RS-232 module** that us the [VSCP serial protocol](http://docs.vscp.org/spec/latest/#/./vscp_over_a_serial_channel_rs-232). The Frankfurt RS-232 module is described [here](https://www.vscp.org/can4vscp-rs232/can4vscp-rs232.html) where there also is a description of how to use it with VSCP Works and the VSCP daemon.

As the VSCP serial protocol is very generic this may also be the driver to use for your own hardware that have a serial port available.

## Parameter String

### Windows

    port[;nBaud]

##### port

The first parameter is the serial port to use (COM1, COM2 and so on).



### Linux

    device[;nBaud]

##### device

The first parameter is the device to use (// /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1 or /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyUSB1 etc // ) etc.

##### nBaud

This is an optional baudrate code. If not given the dafault 115200 will be used. The following settings are available

 | Baudrate | Code | Error  | Windows | Linux |
 | :--------: | :----: | :-----:  | :-------: | :-----: |
 | 115200   | 0    | -1.36% | yes     | yes   |

Tests on Windows and Linux has been done on a Windows 10 machine and on a Ubuntu machine with the USB serial adapter that ship with [Frankfurt RS-232](https://www.vscp.org/frankfurt/rs232/frankfurt-rs232.html).

Typical settings for VSCP daemon config

```xml
    <driver enable="true" >
        <name>can4vscp</name>
        <config>/dev/ttyUSB0</config>
        <path>/usr/local/lib/vscpl1_can4vscpdrv.so</path>
        <flags>0</flags>
        <guid>00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00</guid>
    </driver>
```


## Flags

 | Bits | Usage |
 | ----  | ----- |
 | Bit 0,1  | **Open Mode** <br> **0** - normal <br> **1** - Listen mode <br> **2** - Loopback mode <br> **3** - Reserved |
 | Bit 2    | If set the driver will not switch to VSCP mode. That is it must be in VSCP mode. Open will be faster. |
 | Bit 3    | If set the driver will wait for an ACK from the physical device for every sent frame. This will slow down sending but make transmission it very secure. |
 | Bit 4    | Enable timestamp. The timestamp will be written by the hardware instead of the driver. |
 | Bit 5    | Enable hardware handshake.  |
 | Bit 6 | Enable strict mode. Driver will terminate on all errors.  |
 | Bit 7-30 | Reserved.  |
 | Bit 31 | Enable debug messages to LOG_DEBUG, syslog. (0x80000000 in hex) |

## Status return

The CanalGetStatus call returns the status structure with the channel_status member having the following meaning:

 | Bit      | Description                      |
 | ---      | -----------                      |
 | Bit 0-7  | TX Error Counter.                |
 | Bit 8-15 | RX Error Counter.                |
 | Bit 16   | Overflow. Cleard by status read. |
 | Bit 17   | RX Warning.                      |
 | Bit 18   | TX Warning.                      |
 | Bit 19   | TX bus passive.                  |
 | Bit 20   | RX bus passive.                  |
 | Bit 21   | Reserved.                        |

## Serial Protocol

You can find the description of the VSCP serial protocol in the [VSCP specification](http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpspec/doku.php?id=physical_level_lower_level_protocols#vscp_over_a_serial_channel_rs-232).

## Permissions to use serial port

On Linux you need to have permission to use the serial port. If you have debug enabled for the driver you will see something like this in /var/log/syslog if you have problem with serila port permissons

```
Nov  3 14:12:58 pi3 vscpd: Devicethread: Starting driver_can4vscp
Nov  3 14:12:58 pi3 vscpd: Loading level I driver: can4vscp

Nov  3 14:13:00 pi3 vscpd: [vscpl1drv-can4vscp] NOOP initial command test failed.
Nov  3 14:13:01 pi3 vscpd: [vscpl1drv-can4vscp] Failed to open device in standard mode.
Nov  3 14:13:01 pi3 vscpd: [vscpl1drv-can4vscp] Open success

Nov  3 14:13:01 pi3 vscpd: can4vscp: [Device tread] Level I blocking version.
Nov  3 14:13:01 pi3 vscpd: deviceLevel1WriteThread - m_proc_CanalBlockingSend failed
Nov  3 14:13:01 pi3 vscpd: deviceLevel1WriteThread - m_proc_CanalBlockingSend failed
```

In this case the user the VSCP daemon run as (vscp) does not have rights to use the serial port. If you check permissions with

```bash
sudo ls /dev/ttyUSB0
```

you may see 

```
Crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 4, 64 November 4 14:08 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

meaning you must be root user or part of the **dialout** group to use it. A temporary solution is to make the port accessible by all with

```bash
sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

but this has the drawback that you must set this permission every time the serial device is inserted.

A better solution is to solve this by adding the user **vscp** to the **dialout** group with

```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout vscp
```

## Serial device path

Another problem that can occur with usb serial ports is that the device path change. Your serial port can come up as */dev/ttyUSB0* one time and */dev/ttyUSB1* another time. 

To solve this you can add an udev rule for the device.

First find the device

```
lsusb -v
```

find idVendor and idProduct for your device,

Then do

```
udevadm info -a -n /dev/ttyUSB0 | grep '{serial}' | head -n1
```

which resilt in something like

```
ATTRS{serial}=="3f980000.usb"
```

Now add the line

```
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTRS{idProduct}=="7523", ATTRS{serial}=="3f980000.usb", SYMLINK+="ttyCAN4VSCP"
```

to **/etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb-serial.rules**

changing idVendor/idProduct and ATTRS to the values you obtained.

Now the serial port is accessible as **/dev/ttyCAN4VSCP** even if the the adapter change.
