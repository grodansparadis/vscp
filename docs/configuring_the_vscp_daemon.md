# Configuring the VSCP Daemon

The configuration file is used to tell which drivers should be used and how the VSCP daemon should operate. From version 15.0 this file has changed format from XML to JSON.

As always with configuration files it easy to make changes that make the system nonfunctional. Sp be careful when you edit the file and keep to the JSON standard. Most important keep a backup so that yo can go back to a working copy if something goes wrong.

It is very convenient to use one of the online JSON validators to validate the JSON file when doing a lot of changes. There are many available and a good one is [this one](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/). Just copy the content of the file in the box and validate.

When you change something in the configuration file you have to restart the VSCP daemon for the changes to take effect. You do this with

```bash
sudo systemctl restart vscpd
```

If something is wrong the VSCP daemon may not start. Check the log file at **/var/log/vscpd.log**. You can also use

```bash
ps aux | grep vscpd
```

to see if the VSCP daemon is running or not.



## Location of the configuration file

The daemon needs a configuration file called **vscpd.json**. The server will not start without this file nor if the file contains invalid information or information on invalid format. Normally the installation program will create a default file.

On most machines the configuration file will be located in 

    /etc/vscp/vscpd.json
    
The location that is searched to find the configuration file can be changed with switches when you start the daemon. see the section about [startup switches](http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpd/doku.php?id=vscp_daemon_startup_switches) for each platform.

## To think about before you start :id=think-before

### GUID's :id=think-before-guid

GUID's stands for **G**lobally **U**nique **ID**entifiers and this id is used in VSCP to identify thing. All devices and nodes are identified by a GUID but so is also the VSCP daemon (it is after all a node to) and each of the drivers connected to the server. Check the [VSCP specification](https://docs.vscp.org/#vscpspec) for more information about GUID's.

The daemon needs a GUID assigned to it. Preferably a unique one. It is possible to base a GUID on the machines MAC address if it have an ethernet interface. There is also other id's to build upon. One can also ask for a personal assigned series. See [the VSCP specification](https://docs.vscp.org/#vscpspec) for more info on how.

For most users the MAC address of the machine the VSCP daemon is installed on is the best solution. The installation package will even install a helper script on Linux that help you create this GUID. The script is called **vscp_eth_tp_guid**. To used it you need the name of your ethernet interface. You can get that with

```bash
ip link show
```
Say that your ethernet interface is **eth0** then you can use the script like

```bash
vscp_eth_to_guid eth0
```
and you will get a valid GUID from your ethernet address. You can even use

```bash
sudo vscp_eth_to_guid eth0 /etc/vscp/vscpd.json
```
and the distributed demo GUID's set in the standard file will all be changed.

##  Description of the configuration :id=config-description

The configuration file is a standard JSON file that contains information that tells the VSCP daemon what to do and how it should be done. The information in it is divided into sections and this documentation and each section and it's content is described below.

You can view a sample configuration file [here](https://github.com/grodansparadis/vscp/blob/master/resources/linux/vscpd.json).

## The general section :id=config-general

In the general section you find settings that are common to all components of the VSCP daemon software. 

```json
"runasuser" : "vscp",	
"debug" : 0,	
"guid" : "FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:F5:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:01",

    "console-pattern" : "[vscp %c] [%^%l%$] %v"
}
```

### debug :id=config-gerneral-debug    

The debug entry is a 64-bit number (each bit is a flag)  that enable (if set) a specific debugging capability of the VSCP daemon. If you have problem you should enable the relevant bits to be able to detect the cause for the problem.

The debug bits are defined in [this file](https://github.com/grodansparadis/vscp/blob/master/src/vscp/common/vscp_debug.h).

All flags set is 0xfffffffffffffff whish is 18446744073709551615. A decimal value or a string representing a hexadecimal value can be used to can be set the flags. If a string is used it can but does not have to, be preceded by '0x' or '0X'.

Se the [solving problems](./solving_problems.md) section for more information.

### runasuser :id=config-general-runasuser

__Only on Unix/Linux__. User to run the VSCP daemon as. This is for security and folders for VSCP & friends are set up with permissions for a vscp user on install. By running on this user it is no need to run the VSCP daemon as the root user.

Change to the user you want or set to empty to run as the user who starts the VSCP daemon.


### guid :id=config-gerneral-guid

```xml
<guid>
    FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:F5:00:00:00:00
</guid>
```

Set the server GUID for the daemon. This GUID is the base for the system. 

If not set here (or all nills) a GUID will be formed from the (first) MAC address of the machine the daemon runs on (on Linux needs to be run as root to get this) or if this fails the local IP address is used to form the GUID. The GUID string should be in MSB -> LSB order and have the four lsb set to zero.

**Example**
```
    FF:EE:DD:CC:BB:AA:99:88:77:66:55:44:00:00:00:00
```

### Servername :id=config-general-servername

If set this real text name will be used as an identifier for the server along with the GUID. The default name will be something like

    The VSCP Daemon

### classtypedb :id=config-general-classtypedb
This is a path to a sqlite3 database file that holds information about VSCP events and can give symbolic output from the VSCP daemon. You can for instance have topics that display class or type as token instead of the numerical code. Live this entry blank if you have no interest in this.

Events are added to the VSCP specification as times go by. The database installed with the VSCP daemon is the current at the moment of the release. If you want to update you can find the latest version [here](https://www.vscp.org/events/vscp_events.sqlite3). Update information is [here](https://www.vscp.org/events/version.json). 

Load the latest file with

```bash
cd /var/lib/vscp
sudo wget https://www.vscp.org/events/vscp_events.sqlite3
```

### maindb :id=config-general-maindb
THis is the main database file for the VSCP daemon. It's main content is the discovery database which is used to collect information about nodes in the system.

### vscpkey :id=config-general-vscpkey
This is the path to a security key that the VSCP daemon use to encrypt/decrypt information with. The default is _/var/vscp/vscp.key_ This file should only be editable by the root user and also not be possible to read by any one else.

### debuglevel :id=config-general-debug-level
This is the debug level. Zero is no debugging. A higher number is different levels of debugging detail.

### logging :id=config-general-logging
This is the log console and file settings. Default is to log to the logfile */var/log/vscp/vscpd.log* on Linux and *\program files (x86)\vscp\vscp.log* on Windows. The exception is at vscpd start up, before the configuration file is read and the configured location for the log file is unknown, here logging is done to the console and on Linux also to the syslog.

Modes for logging can be set as of below. In debug/trace mode the debug flag above defines how much info is logged.

#### Logging to file

----
##  MQTT :id=config-mqtt

This is the main MQTT settings of the VSCP daemon. This is where interface and discovery information will be published. Also subscribe topics are here for server information and commands.

Main MQTT settings are derived by drivers and other parts of the system from here. There is no need to repeat information that is the same. Typically a driver, for example, will only differ in subscribe and publish tropics.

```json
"bind" : "",   
"host" : "test.mosquitto.org",
"port" : 1883,
"mqtt-options" : {
    "tcp-nodelay" : true,
    "protocol-version": 311,
    "receive-maximum": 20,
    "send-maximum": 20,
    "ssl-ctx-with-defaults": 0,
    "tls-ocsp-required": 0,
    "tls-use-os-certs" : 0
},
```
### bind :id=config-mqtt-bind
If you want to bind to a specific interface on your machine enter it's address here. 

### host :id=config-mqtt-host
This is the tcp/ip address for the MQTT broker. Default is _127.0.0.1_, the local host.

### port :id=config-mqtt-port
This is the tcp/ip port for the MQTT broker. Default is 1883.

### **mqtt-options** :id=config-mqtt-options
Set special MQTT connect option here.

### tcp-nodelay :id=config-mqtt-options-tcp-nodelay
Disable [Nagle's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle%27s_algorithm) by setting to *true*. This will give more traffic but is anyway preferred for VSCP's small sized events. Setting to *true* disables Nagle's algorithm (default), *false* enables.

### protocol-version :id=config-mqtt-options-protocol-version
The protocol version of MQTT to use. Valid values are 310 for version 3.10 and 311 (default) for version 3.11 and 500 for version 5.

### receive-maximum :id=config-mqtt-options-receive-maximum
Value can be set between 1 and 65535 inclusive, and represents the maximum number of incoming QoS 1 and QoS 2 messages that this client wants to process at once.  Defaults to 20.  This option is not valid for MQTT v3.1 or v3.1.1 clients.  Note that if the MQTT_PROP_RECEIVE_MAXIMUM property is in the proplist passed to mosquitto_connect_v5(), then that property will override this option.  Using this option is the recommended method however.

### send-maximum :id=config-mqtt-options-send-maximum
Value can be set between 1 and 65535 inclusive, and represents the maximum number of outgoing QoS 1 and QoS 2 messages that this client will attempt to have “in flight” at once.  Defaults to 20.  This option is not valid for MQTT v3.1 or v3.1.1 clients.  Note that if the broker being connected to sends a MQTT_PROP_RECEIVE_MAXIMUM property that has a lower value than this option, then the broker provided value will be used.

### ssl-ctx-with-defaults :id=config-mqtt-options-ssl-ctx-with-defaults
If value is set to a non zero value, then the user specified SSL_CTX passed in using MOSQ_OPT_SSL_CTX will have the default options applied to it.  This means that you only need to change the values that are relevant to you.  If you use this option then you must configure the TLS options as normal, i.e.  you should use mosquitto_tls_set to configure the cafile/capath as a minimum.  This option is only available for openssl 1.1.0 and higher.

### tls-ocsp-required :id=config-mqtt-options-tls-ocsp-required
Set whether OCSP checking on TLS connections is required.  Set to 1 to enable checking, or 0 (the default) for no checking.

### tls-use-os-certs :id=config-mqtt-options-tls-use-os-certs
Set to 1 to instruct the client to load and trust OS provided CA certificates for use with TLS connections.  Set to 0 (the default) to only use manually specified CA certs.

## **Drivers** :id=config-drivers

### Assigning GUID's to a driver

Be sure to read [this part](#think-before-guid) before setting driver GUID's.

You are free to pick any GUID you like as long as it (normally) have the two least significant bytes of the GUID available for nodes on the interface to be used as there nicknames. Best and simplest is to select GUID's based on the machines IP or MAC address. For ip-address this is

```
IP:  FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FD:YY:YY:YY:YY:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

where _YY..._ is the IP address. 

and for MAC address it is

```
IP:  FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FE:YY:YY:YY:YY:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

where _YY..._ is the IP address. 

More information about GUID's can be found in the [specification](https://grodansparadis.github.io/vscp-doc-spec/#/./vscp_globally_unique_identifiers).

For a multi driver/interface machine setup, the IP address is the best choice as the user available range XX:XX:XX:XX have room for many interfaces. For instace one can assign 00:00:XX:XX to the first, 00:01:XX:XX to the second etc. Here XX:XX is used for node nicknames. So driver 1 will have GUID

```
FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FD:YY:YY:YY:YY:00:00:00:00
```

and driver 2

```
FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FD:YY:YY:YY:YY:00:01:00:00
```

and so on.

##  Level I Drivers :id=config-level1-driver

Define a VSCP daemon level I driver. If enabled the driver will be loaded. 

Level I drivers was in the past called CANAL (CAN Abstraction Layer) drivers (just because they are).

The content consist of one or several driver entries in an array each representing a level 1 driver that should be used. 

### enable :id=config-level1-driver-enable

Set to true to enable loading of the driver, set to false to disable.

### name :id=config-level1-driver-name

A name given by the user for the driver. This is the name by which the driver is identified bym by the system.

### config :id=config-level1-driver-config

The semicolon separated configuration string for the driver. The meaning of this string is driver specific. See documentation for the driver.

### flags :id=config-level1-driver-flags

A 32 bit driver specific number that have bits set that have special meaning for a driver. See the documentation for a specific driver for an explanation of the meaning of each flag bit for that driver.

### path :id=config-level1-driver-path

This is the path to where the driver is located. Usually points to a file located in in the folder _/var/lib/vscp/drivers/level1/_ where level I drivers by default will be installed.

### guid :id=config-level1-driver-guid

__Must be set to a unique and valid GUID.__   

The GUID that the driver will use for it's interface. This means that this is the GUID that will be the source of Level I events.

Note that the GUID set here should have the two least significant bytes set to zero as they are reserved for nickname id's.

### Translation :id=config-level1-driver-translation

This is a list of semicolon separated fields with translations that should be carried out by the system on event passing through driver.

 | Mnemonic  | Description  | 
 | :--------:  | -----------  | 
 | Bit 1 (1) | Incoming Level I measurement events is translated to Level II measurement, floating point events. | 
 | Bit 2 (2) | Incoming Level I measurement events is translated to Level II measurement, string events.  | 
 | Bit 3 (4) | All incoming events will be translated to class Level I events over Level II, that is have 512 added to it's class. |

## Level II drivers :id=config-level2-driver

Level II drivers can handle the full VSCP abstraction and don't have the small level I maximum payload size of eight bytes and other limitations of the Level I drivers.

[HLO (High Level Objects)](https://grodansparadis.github.io/vscp-doc-spec/#/./class2.hlo) are also understod by this type of drivers.

### enable :id=config-level2-driver-enable

The driver should be loaded if set to true. If false the driver will not be loaded.

### name :id=config-level2-driver-name

A name given by the user for the driver. Should not contain spaces.

### path-driver :id=config-level2-driver-path-driver

This is the path to the driver. Usually points to a file located in _/var/lib/vscp/drivers/level2/_ which is the default installation folder for level II drivers.

### path-config :id=config-level2-driver-path-config

This is the path to the driver configuration file. This file can be located in /etc/vscp for best security or in _/var/lib/vscp/_ if the HLO write ability should be used or in any other suitable place on your disk.

The format of this file is up to the driver creator. JSON format is most common but XML and other formats are also valid.
