# Eclipse Mosquitto Docker Image
Containers built with this Dockerfile build from a source tarball "mosq.tar.gz"
placed in the local directory. Running `make localdocker` from the root of the
repository will generate the source tar and build the docker image.

## Mount Points
A docker mount point has been created in the image to be used for configuration.
```
/mosquitto/config
```

Two docker volumes have been created in the image to be used for persistent storage and logs.
```
/mosquitto/data
/mosquitto/log
```

## User/Group

The image runs mosquitto under the mosquitto user and group, which are created
with a uid and gid of 1883.

## Configuration
When creating a container from the image, the default configuration values are used.
To use a custom configuration file, mount a **local** configuration file to `/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf`
```
docker run -it -p 1883:1883 -v <absolute-path-to-configuration-file>:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf eclipse-mosquitto:<version>
```

:boom: if the mosquitto configuration (mosquitto.conf) was modified
to use non-default ports, the docker run command will need to be updated
to expose the ports that have been configured, for example:

```
docker run -it -p 1883:1883 -p 9001:9001 -v <absolute-path-to-configuration-file>:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf eclipse-mosquitto:<version>
```

Configuration can be changed to:

* persist data to `/mosquitto/data`
* log to `/mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log`

i.e. add the following to `mosquitto.conf`:
```
persistence true
persistence_location /mosquitto/data/

log_dest file /mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log
```

**Note**: For any volume used, the data will be persistent between containers.
